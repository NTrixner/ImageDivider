## ImageDivider
This program is able to divide multiple images according to their parts.
For example, this is useful for scans of multiple photographs.

### Manual Mode
Put your raw images into the "input" folder and start the ManualMode class. Two windows will open: One for the input containing one image from your input folder, and a preview for the output.
DO NOT RESIZE THE INPUT WINDOW, this will break the positioning.
By clicking into the "input" window, you are able to set up to 4 points, which will connect to a polygon. You can change the position of the points after 4 points have been set by clicking and holding the mouse button near one of the points.
After you are happy with the output of the process, you can type "s" to save. In order to change input image, type "c".
The images that you produce will be saved into the "output" folder, and will always be JPGs.
The software does not support alpha channels.
